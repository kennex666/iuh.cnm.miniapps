Mobile App Repo [HERE](https://github.com/kennex666/iuh.cnm.frontend)

## ðŸ”¹ What are Miniapps?
Miniapps are small, pluggable modules that run inside iMessify's chat interface â€“ like embedded tools, games, or utilities â€“ without leaving the conversation.

## ðŸ”¹ Examples

Mini-games (WIP)

## ðŸ”¹ Integration
Each miniapp is designed as a web-based micro-frontend and rendered inside chat via WebView or deep linking. Communication between chat and miniapp follows a secure message-passing protocol.

Inspired by platforms like WeChat Mini Programs, aiming to bring rich in-chat experiences with low overhead.
